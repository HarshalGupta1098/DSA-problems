# Approach #
# every non leaf node has 
# in-degree = 1, out-degree = 2
# and, every leaf node has 
# in-degree = 1, out-degree = 0

# So, everytime we find a non-leaf node, subtract 1 and then add 2.
# And everytime we find a leaf node, subtract 1.
# And one more thing, at any point, 'n' can never be negative or zero, when we are still itertaing the preorder array.

# At last, n should be zero.
