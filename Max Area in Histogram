APPROACH: ->
-> Find all the heights in arr which are >= arr[i], going from left to right.
-> Do the same when going right to left.
-> Now, you know for each 'height' in arr, total number of buildings whose height is >= your building height.
-> ans = max(ans, arr[i]*(left[i]+right[i])-arr[i]) as you are including arr[i] 2 times in the answer.
